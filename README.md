## To start the server
<br>
First, go to the top of the repo and click on code > codespaces > create codespace
<br>
Next you need to run the setup commands:
<br>
<br>
Create 2 terminal tabs and paste the following:<br>
<br>
cd bungee && sudo java -jar bungee.jar
<br>
cd server && sudo java -jar server.jar
<br>
Now go to the ports area and forward (and make public) port `8081`
<br>
Load up the client. When you are in, copy the link, paste it in the add server section, replace https:// with wss:// and join.
